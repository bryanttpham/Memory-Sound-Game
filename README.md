# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess ( Alert popped up outside of my screen recording.)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   The biggest challenge I encounter when creating this submission was learning the syntax of html,css and java srcript. There were many functions that I wanted to implement in this game,however I struggled to find the proper syntax to bring it to life. I understood the logic behind the blocks of code that I would have implemented in this game, but it took a little longer than I expected to find the right syntax to code the project.
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
After completing this submission I had a question optimizing time for web development projects. In contrast to writing algorithms and designing databases, I feel as if web development requires more creativity and thought. Because of this, is there a stigma against using things such as boot strap and other people's framework? I belive that utilizing things such as pre-made templates would enhance to experience and overall outcome of your final product. Is this true?
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would have really liked to implement a winner and loser screen. I had the idea of having confetti fall from the top to the bottom of the screen. The initial plan was to create rotating squares that fall vertically from the top of the screen to the bottom. The function I had intended to write, would have set a constant for the confettis to ensure that there were not too many squares on the screen. Each square that left the bottom of the screen was expected to appear at the top of the screen at a random position.  I thought that this would have been a nice touch to the game. For the losers page I would have liked to use one of the gifs I found that says “the imposter has killed you”. This would have also been a nice addition to the game because it brings a dynamic to the game that makes it more than a memory sound game. The other thing that I would’ve implemented in this game was an aesthetics addition to the buttons.I wanted to transform the Among Us characters to moving gifs when the mouse was hovering over the characters. This would add an element to the game that I thought would’ve been special.
